\arguments{
\item{error_type}{Method to be used to estimate error variances: "mean" uses the mean effect size to estimate error variances and "sample" uses the sample-specific effect sizes.}

\item{conf_level}{Confidence level to define the width of the confidence interval (default = .95).}

\item{cred_level}{Credibility level to define the width of the credibility interval (default = .80).}

\item{conf_method}{Distribution to be used to compute the width of confidence intervals. Available options are "t" for \emph{t} distribution or "norm" for normal distribution.}

\item{cred_method}{Distribution to be used to compute the width of credibility intervals. Available options are "t" for \emph{t} distribution or "norm" for normal distribution.}

\item{var_unbiased}{Logical scalar determining whether variances should be unbiased (\code{TRUE}) or maximum-likelihood (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{pairwise_ads}{Logical value that determines whether to compute artifact distributions in a construct-pair-wise fashion (\code{TRUE}) or separately by construct (\code{FALSE}, default).}

\item{moderated_ads}{Logical value that determines whether to compute artifact distributions separately for each moderator combination (\code{TRUE}) or for overall analyses only (\code{FALSE}, default).}

\item{residual_ads}{Logical argument that determines whether to use residualized variances (\code{TRUE}) or observed variances (\code{FALSE}) of artifact distributions to estimate \code{sd_rho}.}

\item{check_dependence}{Logical scalar that determines whether database should be checked for violations of independence (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{collapse_method}{Character argument that determines how to collapse dependent studies. Options are "composite" (default), "average," and "stop."}

\item{intercor}{The intercorrelation(s) among variables to be combined into a composite. Can be a scalar, a named vector with element named according to the names of constructs, or output from the \code{control_intercor} function. Default scalar value is .5.}

\item{clean_artifacts}{If \code{TRUE}, multiple instances of the same construct (or construct-measure pair, if measure is provided) in the database are compared and reconciled with each other
in the case that any of the matching entries within a study have different artifact values. When \code{impute_method} is anything other than "stop", this method is always implemented to prevent discrepancies among imputed values.}

\item{impute_artifacts}{If \code{TRUE}, artifact imputation will be performed (see \code{impute_method} for imputation procedures). Default is \code{FALSE} for artifact-distribution meta-analyses and \code{TRUE} otherwise.
When imputation is performed, \code{clean_artifacts} is treated as \code{TRUE} so as to resolve all discrepancies among artifact entries before and after imputation.}

\item{impute_method}{Method to use for imputing artifacts. Choices are:
\itemize{
\item{"bootstrap_mod": Select random values from the most specific moderator categories available (default).}
\item{"bootstrap_full": Select random values from the full vector of artifacts.}
\item{"simulate_mod": Generate random values from the distribution with the mean and variance of observed artifacts from the most specific moderator categories available.
(uses \code{rnorm} for u ratios and \code{rbeta} for reliability values).}
\item{"simulate_full": Generate random values from the distribution with the mean and variance of all observed artifacts (uses \code{rnorm} for u ratios and \code{rbeta} for reliability values).}
\item{"wt_mean_mod": Replace missing values with the sample-size weighted mean of the distribution of artifacts from the most specific moderator categories available (not recommended).}
\item{"wt_mean_full": Replace missing values with the sample-size weighted mean of the full distribution of artifacts (not recommended).}
\item{"unwt_mean_mod": Replace missing values with the unweighted mean of the distribution of artifacts from the most specific moderator categories available (not recommended).}
\item{"unwt_mean_full": Replace missing values with the unweighted mean of the full distribution of artifacts (not recommended).}
\item{"replace_unity": Replace missing values with 1 (not recommended).}
\item{"stop": Stop evaluations when missing artifacts are encountered.}
}
If an imputation method ending in "mod" is selected but no moderators are provided, the "mod" suffix will internally be replaced with "full".}

\item{seed}{Seed value to use for imputing artifacts in a reproducible way. Default value is 42.}

\item{use_all_arts}{Logical scalar that determines whether artifact values from studies without valid effect sizes should be used in artifact distributions (\code{TRUE}; default) or not (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{estimate_pa}{Logical scalar that determines whether the unrestricted subgroup proportions associated with univariate-range-restricted effect sizes should be estimated by rescaling the range-restricted subgroup proportions as a function of the range-restriction correction (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}; default).}

\item{decimals}{Number of decimal places to which interactive artifact distributions should be rounded (default is 2 decimal places).}

\item{hs_override}{When \code{TRUE}, this will override settings for \code{wt_type} (will set to "sample_size"), 
\code{error_type} (will set to "mean"),
\code{correct_bias} (will set to \code{TRUE}), 
\code{conf_method} (will set to "norm"),
\code{cred_method} (will set to "norm"), 
\code{var_unbiased} (will set to \code{FALSE}), 
\code{residual_ads} (will be set to \code{FALSE}),
and \code{use_all_arts} (will set to \code{FALSE}).}

\item{zero_substitute}{Value to be used as a functionally equivalent substitute for exactly zero effect sizes in individual-correction meta-analyses to facilitate the estimation of corrected error variances. By default, this is set to \code{.Machine$double.eps}.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to be passed to functions called within the meta-analysis.}
