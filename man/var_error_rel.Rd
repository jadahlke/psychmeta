\title{Estimate the error variance of reliability estimates}
\usage{
var_error_rel(rel, n, rel_type = "alpha", k_items = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{rel}{Vector of reliability estimates.}

\item{n}{Vector of sample sizes.}

\item{rel_type}{Character vector indicating the type(s) of reliabilities being analyzed. See documentation for \code{\link[=ma_r]{ma_r()}} for a full list of acceptable reliability types.
NOTE: Currently, only \eqn{\alpha} has its own dedicated error-variance estimate; the error variance of other reliability types is estimated using the generic definition of reliability as the squared correlation between observed scores and true scores.}

\item{k_items}{Optional numeric vector indicating the number of items in each scale for which reliabilities are being analyzed.}
}
\value{
A vector of sampling-error variances.
}
\description{
Estimate error variance for reliability coefficients (\eqn{r_{XX}}{r_XX}).
}
\details{
The sampling variance of a reliability coefficient is:

\deqn{var_{e}=\frac{4r_{XX}(1-r_{XX})^{2}}{n-1}}{var_e = 4 * rxx * (1 - rxx)^2 / (n - 1)}

For the equation to estimate the variance of coefficient \eqn{\alpha}, see Duhachek and Iacobucci (2004).
