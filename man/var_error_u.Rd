\title{Estimate the error variance of \eqn{u} ratios}
\usage{
var_error_u(u, ni, na = NA, dependent_sds = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{u}{Vector of \eqn{u} ratios.}

\item{ni}{Vector of incumbent-group sample sizes.}

\item{na}{Vector of applicant-group sample sizes.}

\item{dependent_sds}{Logical vector identifying whether each \eqn{u} ratio is based on standard deviations from independent samples (\code{FALSE}) or based on
standard deviations from an applicant sample and an incumbent sample that is a subset of that applicant sample (\code{TRUE}).}
}
\value{
A vector of sampling-error variances.
}
\description{
Estimates the error variance of standard deviation (\eqn{u}) ratios.
}
\details{
The sampling variance of a u ratio is computed differently for independent samples (i.e., settings where the referent unrestricted standard deviation comes from an different sample than the range-restricted standard deviation) than for dependent samples (i.e., unrestricted samples from which a subset of individuals are selected to be in the incumbent sample).

The sampling variance for independent samples (the more common case) is:

\deqn{var_{e}=\frac{u^{2}}{2}\left(\frac{1}{n_{i}-1}+\frac{1}{n_{a}-1}\right)}{var_e = .5 * u^2 * (1 / (ni - 1) + 1 / (na - 1))}

and the sampling variance for dependent samples is:

\deqn{var_{e}=\frac{u^{2}}{2}\left(\frac{1}{n_{i}-1}-\frac{1}{n_{a}-1}\right)}{var_e = .5 * u^2 * (1 / (ni - 1) - 1 / (na - 1))}

where \eqn{u} is the u ratio, \eqn{n_{i}}{ni} is the incumbent sample size, and \eqn{n_{a}}{na} is the applicant sample size.
