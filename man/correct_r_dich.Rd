\title{Correct correlations for artificial dichotomization of one or both variables}
\usage{
correct_r_dich(r, px = NA, py = NA, n = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{Vector of correlations attenuated by artificial dichomization.}

\item{px}{Vector of proportions of the distribution on either side of the split applied to X (set as NA if X is continuous).}

\item{py}{Vector of proportions of the distribution on either side of the split applied to Y (set as NA if Y is continuous).}

\item{n}{Optional vector of sample sizes.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments.}
}
\value{
Vector of correlations corrected for artificial dichomization (if \code{n} is supplied, corrected error variance and adjusted sample size is also reported).
}
\description{
Correct correlations for artificial dichotomization of one or both variables.
}
\details{
\deqn{r_{c}=\frac{r_{obs}}{\left[\frac{\phi\left(p_{X}\right)}{p_{X}\left(1-p_{X}\right)}\right]\left[\frac{\phi\left(p_{Y}\right)}{p_{Y}\left(1-p_{Y}\right)}\right]}}{r_c = r_obs / (ordinate(p_x) / sqrt(p_x * (1 - p_x) * ordinate(p_y) / sqrt(p_y * (1 - p_y))}
