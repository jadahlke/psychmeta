\title{Correct for small-sample bias in Cohen's \eqn{d} values}
\usage{
correct_d_bias(d, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{Vector of Cohen's d values.}

\item{n}{Vector of sample sizes.}
}
\value{
Vector of g values (d values corrected for small-sample bias).
}
\description{
Corrects a vector of Cohen's \eqn{d} values for small-sample bias, as Cohen's \eqn{d}
has a slight positive bias. The bias-corrected \eqn{d} value is often called
Hedges's \eqn{g}.
}
\details{
The bias correction is:
\deqn{g = d_{c} = d_{obs} \times J}{g = d_c = d * J}

where
\deqn{J = \frac{\Gamma(\frac{n - 2}{2})}{\sqrt{\frac{n - 2}{2}} \times \Gamma(\frac{n - 3}{2})}}{J = \Gamma((n - 2) / 2) / (sqrt(n - 2) * \Gamma((n - 2) / 2))}

and \eqn{d_{obs}}{d} is the observed effect size, \eqn{g = d_{c}}{g = d_c} is the
corrected (unbiased) estimate, \eqn{n} is the total sample size, and
\eqn{\Gamma()}{\Gamma()} is the \link[base:Special]{gamma function}.

Historically, using the gamma function was computationally intensive, so an
approximation for \eqn{J} was used (Borenstein et al., 2009):
\deqn{J = 1 - 3 / (4 * (n - 2) - 1)}{J = 1 - 3 / (4 * (n - 2) - 1}

This approximation is no longer necessary with modern computers.
