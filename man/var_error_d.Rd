\title{Estimate the error variance Cohen's \eqn{d} values}
\usage{
var_error_d(d, n1, n2 = NA, correct_bias = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{Vector of Cohen's \eqn{d} values.}

\item{n1}{Vector of sample sizes from group 1 (or the total sample size with the assumption that groups are of equal size, if no group 2 sample size is supplied).}

\item{n2}{Vector of sample sizes from group 2.}

\item{correct_bias}{Logical argument that determines whether to correct error-variance estimates for small-sample bias in d values (TRUE) or not (FALSE).}
}
\value{
A vector of sampling-error variances.
}
\description{
Estimates the error variance of standardized mean differences (Cohen's \eqn{d} values)
}
\details{
Allows for error variance to be estimated using total sample size of both groups being compared (in this case, supply sample sizes using only the n1 argument) or
using separate sample sizes for group 1 and group 2 (i.e., the groups being compared; in this case, supply sample sizes using both the n1 and n2 arguments).

The sampling variance of a \eqn{d} value is:

\deqn{\left(\frac{n-1}{n-3}\right)\left(\frac{n_{1}+n_{2}}{n_{1}n_{2}}+\frac{d^{2}}{2(n_{1}+n_{2})}\right)}{var_e = ((n - 1) / (n - 3)) * ((n1 + n2) / (n1 * n2) + d^2 / (2 * (n1 + n2)))}

When groups 1 and 2 are of equal size, this reduces to

\deqn{var_{e}=\left(\frac{n-1}{n-3}\right)\left(\frac{4}{n}\right)\left(1+\frac{d^{2}}{8}\right)}{var_e = ((n - 1) / (n - 3)) * (4 / n) * (1 + d^2 / 8)}

This can be corrected for bias by first correcting the \eqn{d} value (see \code{\link[=correct_d_bias]{correct_d_bias()}}) prior to estimating the error variance.
