\title{Internal function for computing individual-correction meta-analyses of correlations}
\usage{
.ma_r_order2(data, type = "all", run_lean = FALSE, ma_arg_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame of individual-correction information.}

\item{type}{Type of correlation to be meta-analyzed: "ts" for true score, "vgx" for validity generalization with "X" as the predictor,
"vgy" for for validity generalization with "Y" as the predictor, and "all" for the complete set of results.}

\item{run_lean}{If TRUE, the meta-analysis will not generate a data object. Meant to speed up bootstrap analyses that do not require supplemental output.}

\item{ma_arg_list}{List of arguments to be used in the meta-analysis function.}
}
\value{
A meta-analytic table and a data frame.
