\arguments{
\item{correction}{Type of correction to be applied. Options are "meas", "uvdrr_g", "uvdrr_y", "uvirr_g", "uvirr_y", "bvdrr", "bvirr"}

\item{d}{Vector of \eqn{d} values.}

\item{ryy}{Vector of reliability coefficients for Y (the continuous variable).}

\item{uy}{Vector of u ratios for Y (the continuous variable).}

\item{rGg}{Vector of reliabilities for the group variable (i.e., the correlations between observed group membership and latent group membership).}

\item{pi}{Proportion of cases in one of the groups in the observed data (not necessary if \code{n1} and \code{n2} reflect this proportionality).}

\item{pa}{Proportion of cases in one of the groups in the population.}

\item{uy_observed}{Logical vector in which each entry specifies whether the corresponding uy value is an observed-score u ratio (\code{TRUE}) or a true-score u ratio. All entries are \code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{ryy_restricted}{Logical vector in which each entry specifies whether the corresponding rxx value is an incumbent reliability (\code{TRUE}) or an applicant reliability. All entries are \code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{ryy_type}{String vector identifying the types of reliability estimates supplied (e.g., "alpha", "retest", "interrater_r", "splithalf"). See the documentation for \code{\link[=ma_r]{ma_r()}} for a full list of acceptable reliability types.}

\item{k_items_y}{Numeric vector identifying the number of items in each scale.}

\item{sign_rgz}{Vector of signs of the relationships between grouping variables and the selection mechanism.}

\item{sign_ryz}{Vector of signs of the relationships between Y variables and the selection mechanism.}

\item{n1}{Optional vector of sample sizes associated with group 1 (or the total sample size, if \code{n2} is \code{NULL}).}

\item{n2}{Optional vector of sample sizes associated with group 2.}

\item{conf_level}{Confidence level to define the width of the confidence interval (default = .95).}

\item{correct_bias}{Logical argument that determines whether to correct error-variance estimates for small-sample bias in correlations (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}).
For sporadic corrections (e.g., in mixed artifact-distribution meta-analyses), this should be set to \code{FALSE} (the default).}
}
\value{
Data frame(s) of observed \eqn{d} values (\code{dgyi}), operational range-restricted \eqn{d} values corrected for measurement error in Y only (\code{dgpi}), operational range-restricted \eqn{d} values corrected for measurement error in the grouping only (\code{dGyi}), and range-restricted true-score \eqn{d} values (\code{dGpi}),
range-corrected observed-score \eqn{d} values (\code{dgya}), operational range-corrected \eqn{d} values corrected for measurement error in Y only (\code{dgpa}), operational range-corrected \eqn{d} values corrected for measurement error in the grouping only (\code{dGya}), and range-corrected true-score \eqn{d} values (\code{dGpa}).

\description{
This function is a wrapper for the \code{\link[=correct_r]{correct_r()}} function to correct \eqn{d} values
for statistical and psychometric artifacts.
