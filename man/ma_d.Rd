\emph{NOTE}: Beginning in \pkg{psychmeta} version 2.5.2, \code{d} values of exactly 0 in individual-correction meta-analyses are replaced with a functionally equivalent value (in the correlation metric) via the \code{zero_substitute} argument for \code{\link{control_psychmeta}} to facilitate the estimation of corrected error variances.}

\item{n2}{Vector or column name of sample sizes.}

\item{n_adj}{Optional: Vector or column name of sample sizes adjusted for sporadic artifact corrections.}

\item{sample_id}{Optional vector of identification labels for samples/studies in the meta-analysis.}

\item{citekey}{Optional vector of bibliographic citation keys for samples/studies in the meta-analysis (if multiple citekeys pertain to a given effect size, combine them into a single string entry with comma delimiters (e.g., "citkey1,citekey2").}

\item{treat_as_r}{Logical scalar determining whether \emph{d} values are to be meta-analyzed as \emph{d} values (\code{FALSE}; default) or whether they should be meta-analyzed as correlations and have the final results converted to the \emph{d} metric (\code{TRUE}).}

"rbOrig", "rb1Orig", "rb2Orig", "rbAdj", "rb1Adj", and "rb2Adj".
(note: "rb1Orig", "rb2Orig", "rb1Adj", and "rb2Adj" can only be used when Taylor series artifact distributions are provided and "rbOrig" and "rbAdj" can only
be used when interactive artifact distributions are provided). See "Details" of \code{\link{ma_d_ad}} for descriptions of the available methods.}

\description{
The \code{ma_r_bb}, \code{ma_r_ic}, and \code{ma_r_ad} functions implement bare-bones, individual-correction, and artifact-distribution correction methods for \emph{d} values, respectively.
The \code{ma_d} function is the master function for meta-analyses of \emph{d} values - it facilitates the computation of bare-bones, artifact-distribution, and individual-correction meta-analyses of correlations for any number of group-wise contrasts and any number of dependent variables.
When artifact-distribution meta-analyses are performed, \code{ma_d} will automatically extract the artifact information from a database and organize it into the requested type of artifact distribution object (i.e., either Taylor series or interactive artifact distributions).
\code{ma_d} is also equipped with the capability to clean databases containing inconsistently recorded artifact data, impute missing artifacts (when individual-correction meta-analyses are requested), and remove dependency among samples by forming composites or averaging effect sizes and artifacts.
The automatic compositing features in \code{ma_d} are employed when \code{sample_id}s and/or construct names are provided.
}
\details{
The options for \code{correction_method} are:
\itemize{
\item{"auto"}{\cr Automatic selection of the most appropriate correction procedure, based on the available artifacts and the logical arguments provided to the function. (default)}
\item{"meas"}{\cr Correction for measurement error only.}
\item{"uvdrr"}{\cr Correction for univariate direct range restriction (i.e., Case II). The choice of which variable to correct for range restriction is made using the \code{correct_rr_x} and \code{correct_rr_y} arguments.}
\item{"uvirr"}{\cr Correction for univariate indirect range restriction (i.e., Case IV). The choice of which variable to correct for range restriction is made using the \code{correct_rr_x} and \code{correct_rr_y} arguments.}
\item{"bvdrr"}{\cr Correction for bivariate direct range restriction. Use with caution: This correction is an approximation only and is known to have a positive bias.}
\item{"bvirr"}{\cr Correction for bivariate indirect range restriction (i.e., Case V).}
\item{"rbOrig"}{\cr Not recommended: Raju and Burke's version of the correction for direct range restriction, applied interactively. We recommend using "uvdrr" instead.}
\item{"rbAdj"}{\cr Not recommended: Raju and Burke's version of the correction for direct range restriction, applied interactively. Adjusted to account for range restriction in the reliability of the Y variable. We recommend using "uvdrr" instead.}
\item{"rb1Orig"}{\cr Not recommended: Raju and Burke's version of the correction for direct range restriction, applied using their TSA1 method. We recommend using "uvdrr" instead.}
\item{"rb1Adj"}{\cr Not recommended: Raju and Burke's version of the correction for direct range restriction, applied using their TSA1 method. Adjusted to account for range restriction in the reliability of the Y variable. We recommend using "uvdrr" instead.}
\item{"rb2Orig"}{\cr Not recommended: Raju and Burke's version of the correction for direct range restriction, applied using their TSA2 method. We recommend using "uvdrr" instead.}
\item{"rb2Adj"}{\cr Not recommended: Raju and Burke's version of the correction for direct range restriction, applied using their TSA2 method. Adjusted to account for range restriction in the reliability of the Y variable. We recommend using "uvdrr" instead.}
}
}
\section{Note}{

The difference between "rb" methods with the "orig" and "adj" suffixes is that the original does not account for the impact of range restriction on criterion reliabilities, whereas
the adjusted procedure attempts to estimate the applicant reliability information for the criterion. The "rb" procedures are included for posterity: We strongly recommend using
the "uvdrr" procedure to appropriately correct for univariate range restriction.

### Demonstration of ma_d ###
## The 'ma_d' function can compute multi-construct bare-bones meta-analyses:
ma_d(d = d, n1 = n1, n2 = n2, construct_y = construct, data = data_d_meas_multi)

## It can also perform multiple individual-correction meta-analyses:
ma_d(ma_method = "ic", d = d, n1 = n1, n2 = n2, ryy = ryyi,
     construct_y = construct, data = data_d_meas_multi)

## And 'ma_d' can also curate artifact distributions and compute multiple
## artifact-distribution meta-analyses:
ma_d(ma_method = "ad", d = d, n1 = n1, n2 = n2,
     ryy = ryyi, correct_rr_y = FALSE,
     construct_y = construct, data = data_d_meas_multi)
