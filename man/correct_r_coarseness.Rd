\usage{
correct_r_coarseness(
  r,
  kx = NULL,
  ky = NULL,
  n = NULL,
  dist_x = "norm",
  dist_y = "norm",
  bin_value_x = c("median", "mean", "index"),

}
\arguments{
\item{r}{Observed correlation.}

\item{kx, ky}{Number of scale points used to measure the x and y variables. Set to NULL to treat as continuously measured.}

\item{n}{Optional sample size.}

\item{dist_x, dist_y}{Assumed latent distribution of the x and y variables.}

\item{bin_value_x, bin_value_y}{Are the scale points used to measure the of the x and y variables assumed to represent bin medians, means, or index values?}

\item{width_x, width_y}{For symmetrically distributed variables, how many standard deviations above/below the latent mean should be be used for the latent variable range to make the correction? (Note: Setting \code{width} > 3 produces erratic results.) The latent variable range can alternatively be set using \code{lbound} and \code{ubound}.}

\item{lbound_x, lbound_y}{What lower bound of the range for the latent x and y variables should be used to make the correction? (Note: For normally distributed variables, setting \code{lbound} < -3 produces erratic results.)}

\item{ubound_x, ubound_y}{What upper bound of the range for the latent x and y variables should be used to make the correction? (Note: For normally distributed variables, setting \code{ubound} > 3 produces erratic results.)}

\item{index_values_x, index_values_y}{Optional. If \code{bin_value} = "index", the bin index values. If unspecified, values 1:k are used.}
}
\value{
Vector of correlations corrected for scale coarseness (if \code{n} is supplied, corrected error variance and adjusted sample size is also reported).
